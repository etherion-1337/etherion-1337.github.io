## Question

Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_\(graph_theory\)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```java
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

    Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

    Input: adjList = [[]]
    Output: [[]]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**

    Input: adjList = []
    Output: []
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## Solution

### concept
Use a hashmap to keep track the mapping from old node to new node. This hashmap has 2 purposes:
1) check if a node has been cloned in $O(1)$
2) if cloned, we can retrieve and return the cloned node directly in $O(1)$
Please note the Python stores reference (pointer) and not snapshot, so `old_to_new[node] = copy` both points to the same address of the node, if we modify the node, all calling to the node can reflect that.

### code
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
