## Question

Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

    Input: root = [2,1,3]
    Output: true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

    Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
    Output: false
**Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`

## Solution

### concept
A naive solution where we just check `curr.left.val < curr.val < curr.right.val` will not work for case like
```markdown
    5
   / \
  1   8
     / \
    4   9

```
due to `4` should satisfy `5<4<8` but it is not.
Therefore the way to solve this question is to maintain a range `(low, high)` such that `low < curr.val < high`.
When we go to the left subtree, we update the `high` boundary, when we go to the right subtree, we update the `low` boundary 

### code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
        def dfs(curr, low, high):
            if not curr:
                return True

            if not (low < curr.val < high):
                return False
    
            left_check = dfs(curr.left, low, curr.val)
            right_check = dfs(curr.right, curr.val, high)

            return left_check and right_check

        return dfs(root, float("-inf"), float("inf"))
```
