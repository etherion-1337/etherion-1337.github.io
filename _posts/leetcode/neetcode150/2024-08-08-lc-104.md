## Question

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _its maximum depth_.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)

    Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    Output: 3

**Example 2:**

    Input: root = [1,null,2]
    Output: 2

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution

### concept

There are 3 ways to solve it.

#### recursive DFS
This is the easiest way, we break down the problem to find the max of the `right subtree` and `left subtree`, and return to the parent node with `1 + max(max of right subtree, max of left subtree)` to factor in the depth of the current node.

#### BFS
BFS will need a `deque` data structure to do level order traversal:
1. we pop from the left the current level node and add their children (if not null) from the right.
2. we need a `for` loop with `range(len(q))` to take snap shot of the current level's node (so we know how much to traversal in the `deque` in order to precisely cover the current level, since we will be adding next level's node from the right at the same time so the `deque` gets longer)

#### iterative DFS
Preorder DFS is the easiest to implement iterative DFS. We need a `stack` data structure to keep track `[(node.val, depth)]`. We just pop the current node and add in its children along with `current depth + 1`. As we pop all the nodes within the stack, we keep track the max depth so far.

### code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

        if not root:
            return 0
        
        left_max = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        right_max = self.maxDepth(root.right)

        return 1 + max(left_max, right_max)

        depth = 0
        q = deque([root])

        while q:
            for i in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            depth += 1
        return depth

	"""
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        ans = 0
        stack = [(root, 1)]
        while stack:
            node, depth = stack.pop()
            if node:
                ans = max(ans, depth)
                stack.append([node.left, depth + 1])
                stack.append([node.right, depth + 1])
        
        return ans
```

## Complexity
### recursive DFS
Time complexity: $O(n)$
Space complexity: $O(h)$
- Best Case ([balanced tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/balanced-binary-tree/)): $O(\log(n))$
- Worst Case ([degenerate tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-degenerate-binary-tree/)): $O(n)$
