## Question

Given an `m x n` `board` of characters and a list of strings `words`, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where **adjacent cells** are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example 1:**

    Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
    Output: ["eat","oath"]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/07/search2.jpg)

    Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
    Output: []

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `board[i][j]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words` are unique.

## Solution

### concept
This question needs Trie + standard DFS to solve.

### code
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.end_of_word = False

    def add_word(self, word):
        cur = self
        for c in word:
            if c not in cur.children:
                cur.children[c] = TrieNode()
            cur = cur.children[c]
        cur.end_of_word = True

class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        root = TrieNode()
        for w in words:
            root.add_word(w)
        
        ROWS, COLS = len(board), len(board[0])
        result, visited = set(), set()
        directions = [[0,1], [1,0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]]

        def dfs(r, c, node, word):
            if (r < 0 or r >= ROWS or
                c < 0 or c >= COLS or 
                (r,c) in visited or board[r][c] not in node.children):
                return
            
            visited.add((r, c))
            node = node.children[board[r][c]]
            word += board[r][c]
            if node.end_of_word:
                result.add(word)
            
            for dr, dc in directions:
                dfs(r + dr, c + dc, node, word)

            visited.remove((r,c))

        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                dfs(r,c, root, "")
        
        return list(result)
```
