## Question

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
- `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `0` _if no such sequence exists._

**Example 1:**

    Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
    Output: 5
**Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

**Example 2:**

    Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
    Output: 0
**Explanation:** The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.

## Solution

### concept
The key concept is to realise this is a graph problem.
The most difficult part of the question is to construct the adjacency list. The normal way of doing it will cause TLE.

### code

```python
class Solution:
    """
    graph + BFS
    each node is a word, each edge is a transformation (single edit distance)
    find the shortest path from beginWord to endWord
    """
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return 0
        # create adjacency list: {pattern: [word]}
        # e.g. {*it : [hit, hot]}
        # use a wild card pattern such that this process is n*m^2
        # if use double loop is is n^2*m which will TLE
        neighbor_map = defaultdict(list)
        wordList.append(beginWord) # wordList does not contain begin word
        for word in wordList:
            for j in range(len(word)):
                pattern = word[:j] + "*" + word[j+1:]
                neighbor_map[pattern].append(word) 
        # BFS
        visited = set([beginWord])
        q = deque([beginWord])
        result = 1

        while q:
            for i in range(len(q)):
                word = q.popleft()
                if word == endWord:
                    return result
                for j in range(len(word)):
                    pattern = word[:j] + "*" + word[j+1:]
                    for neighbor in neighbor_map[pattern]:
                        if neighbor not in visited:
                            visited.add(neighbor)
                            q.append(neighbor)
            result += 1

        return 0
```
