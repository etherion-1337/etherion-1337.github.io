## Question

You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `ith` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the **heaviest two stones** and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return _the weight of the last remaining stone_. If there are no stones left, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

    Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1

**Explanation:** 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.

**Example 2:**

    Input: stones = [1]
    Output: 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
- `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

### concept
Use a max heap to solve this question

### code

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        max_heap = [-1*stone for stone in stones]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)

        while len(max_heap) > 1:
            stone_1 = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            stone_2 = heapq.heappop(max_heap)

            if stone_1 != stone_2:
                diff = stone_1 - stone_2
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, diff)

        return -1*max_heap[0] if max_heap else 0

class NeetSolution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-s for s in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)

        while len(stones) > 1:
            first = heapq.heappop(stones)
            second = heapq.heappop(stones)
            if second > first:
                heapq.heappush(stones, first - second)
        # for edge case where no stone is left after the loop
        stones.append(0)
        return abs(stones[0])
```
