## Question

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]

**Example 3:**

    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n^2)` time complexity?

## Solution

### concept

We will keep a hash map that stores `value: index` and we will check if the reminder is in the map.
Take note that we will first check whether reminder is in the map or not, and then add the value into the map. This is to handle edge cases such as `2+2=4` since if we add in `2` first we would return `True` for the reminder since `2` is already in it. This is obviously wrong.

### code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        prevMap = {}  # val -> index

        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - n
            if diff in prevMap:
                return [prevMap[diff], i]
            prevMap[n] = i
```

## Complexity
time: $O(n)$    
space: $O(n)$
