## Question

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without duplicate characters.

**Example 1:**

    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3

**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

**Example 2:**

    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1

**Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**

    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3

**Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.     
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solution

### concept

Use a sliding window and maintain a `set` of char seen so far. Whenever the `r` pointer seen a duplicate, we will move the `l` pointer until this duplicate is removed from the seen set.       
Then we will move the `r` pointer again. We will then return the maximum length through a greedy method.

### code
```python
class MySolution:
	"""
	sliding window
	using 2 while loop
	"""
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0

        l, r = 0, 0
        ans = 0 
        char_set = set()

        while r < len(s):
            if s[r] not in char_set:
                char_set.add(s[r])
                ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)
                r += 1
            else:
                while s[r] in char_set:
                    char_set.remove(s[l])
                    l += 1
        return ans

class NeetSolution:
	"""
	sliding window
	using for + while
	"""
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        charSet = set()
        l = 0
        res = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            charSet.add(s[r])
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        return res
```
## Complexity
time: $O(n)$, `n` is the length of the string     
space: $O(m)$, `m` is the total number of unique char in the string.
